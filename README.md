# Vector Space Semantics for Character Analysis in "Friends"

## Overview
This project explores vector space semantics in Natural Language Processing by analyzing dialogue from the TV show "Friends". The goal is to create distinctive vector representations for each character and use these representations to classify lines from the show according to who said them. This involves advanced text preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of similarity-based classification.

## Features
- **Vector Representation**: Building vector representations of character dialogue using advanced NLP techniques.
- **Preprocessing and Feature Extraction**: Applying various preprocessing methods and feature extraction techniques like n-grams, POS tagging, and TF-IDF.
- **Similarity-Based Classification**: Utilizing similarity measures to classify dialogue lines to the corresponding characters.
- **Context and Scene Analysis**: Incorporating the context of scenes and dialogues for more accurate character representation.

## Technologies
- Python
- Libraries: scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and others for NLP processing.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of lines spoken by characters from "Friends", divided into training, validation, and test sets.

## Implementation Details
- **Data Preprocessing**: Custom functions to preprocess the text data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Techniques like n-grams, POS tagging, and sentiment analysis to enrich the feature set.
- **Model Evaluation**: Employing information retrieval metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the vector representations.
- **Optimization**: Systematically searching for the best parameters and methods to improve model performance.

## Usage
The repository contains Jupyter notebooks that detail the entire process from data preparation to model evaluation and optimization.

## Contributions
Suggestions and contributions for enhancing the model or experimenting with new feature extraction methods are welcome.
